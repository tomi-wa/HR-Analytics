### Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end HR Analytics case study focused on understanding employee attendance patterns, productivity behavior, and potential attrition risks. Using Excel-based analytics tools, raw HR datasets were transformed into clean, modeled, and business-ready insights to support data-driven HR decision-making.

The project follows a structured analytics workflow similar to real-life organizational HR reporting environments.

### Objectives
- Assess workforce productivity beyond simple averages
- Analyze absenteeism and overtime patterns
- Identify early indicators of employee attrition risk
- Build an executive-friendly HR dashboard

### Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)
- Power Pivot & DAX (data modeling & calculations)
- PivotTables & PivotCharts
- Dashboard Design Best Practices

### Dataset Description
- The dataset simulates internal HR systems and includes:
- Employee master data
- Attendance records
- Productivity and performance scores
- Overtime information
This mirrors real-world HR data typically sourced from internal systems rather than public datasets.
### Project Workflow
- Problem Definition & Planning
- Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power Query)
- Data Modeling (Power Pivot)
- KPI Development
- Department-Level & Attrition Analysis
- Dashboard Design & Visualization

### Key Insights
- Average productivity alone can mask performance differences across departments
- Productivity distribution provides deeper insight into workforce performance
- Absenteeism and overtime act as early indicators of potential attrition
- Overall attrition risk is low but requires continuous monitoring
### Recommendations
- Use distribution-based metrics alongside averages in HR reporting
- Monitor absenteeism and overtime trends proactively
- Focus engagement efforts on departments showing early risk indicators
